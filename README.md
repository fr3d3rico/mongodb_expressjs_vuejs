# MongoDB + ExpressJS + VueJS
Test app to apply MongoDB + ExpressJS + VueJS.

This project focus on use of the follow stack: 

MongoDB (https://docs.mongodb.com/)

ExpressJS (https://expressjs.com/)

VueJS (https://vuejs.org/)

## Tools and Super Libs present in this project

This project use mongoose(http://mongoosejs.com/) to access MongoDB from Node application server.

I also use mongoose-paginate(https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose-paginate) to perform pagination query. This plugin is amazing!

The project not focus to manage front-end dependencies like bower. However, this SPA (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) project use CDN to import bootstrap, jquery and vuejs.
Feel free to improve and apply an better approach for front-end architecture.

## Prerequistes
